- When I tried to import the mapping from the database based on workbench databased generation I have this error :
[Doctrine\ORM\Mapping\MappingException]                                              
  Property "user" in "Ticket" was already declared, but it must be declared only once

It was due to the fact that doctrine does not recognise composite primary key and don't like primary key usage as foreign key in other related table.

The solution was to make the composite primary key as two foreign keys and add new primary key
